            <p>Ariana Grande-Butera, born June 26, 1993, is an American singer, 
                songwriter, and actress. Born in Boca Raton, Florida, Grande began her career in the 2008 
                Broadway musical 13 and rose to prominence for her role as Cat Valentine in the Nickelodeon 
                television series Victorious (2010–2013), and in its spin-off, Sam & Cat (2013–2014). 
                After she grew interested in pursuing a music career, Grande recorded songs for the soundtrack of 
                Victorious, and signed with Republic Records in 2011 after the label's executives discovered 
                videos of her covering songs that she uploaded onto YouTube. She released her debut album, 
                Yours Truly (2013). A 1950s doo-wop-influenced pop and R&B album, it debuted atop the US
                Billboard 200 and spawned her first US Billboard Hot 100 top-ten single, "The Way".</p>
